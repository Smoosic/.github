# Welcome to the Smoosic Project
Most project work for Smoosic will be on the 
[main repository](https://github.com/Smoosic/Smoosic). If you are interested in further disucssions, please head over there.

* Smoosic is a typescript/javascript music notation program that runs in the browser
* SMO is a JSON-based file format. It stands for 'Serialized Musical Objects'.


Here is a breakdown of the sub-projects:

1. [Smoosic](https://github.com/Smoosic/Smoosic) library is the source code for the application and associated library, and is the main Smoosic project repository.
1. [vexflow_smoosic](https://github.com/Smoosic/vexflow_smoosic) repository contains the vexflow engraving library, a sister-project of Smoosic.
1. [SmoSchema](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoSchema) contains the definition of the Serializable Music Objects that Smoosic uses to persist files, and tools for validation, and possibly other utilities.
1. [Demos](https://github.com/Smoosic/Demos) contains test and demo applications. If you want to use Smoosic as a library in your own applications, you can use this as a model.
1. [SmoSounds](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoSounds) library contains .mp3 samples used for audio playback, and referenced in the demo projects.
1. [SmoScores](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoScores) The repository for music written in SMO, or for the SMO application. Contributions and fixes to the default library are welcome.
