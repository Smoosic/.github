# Welcome to the Smoosic Project
This is a top-level readme for the Smoosic music project:

* Smoosic is a typescript/javascript music notation program that runs in the browser
* SMO is a JSON-based file format. It stands for 'Serialized Musical Objects'.

Most project work for Smoosic will be on the main repository . If you are interested in further disucssions, please head over there.

Here is a breakdown of the sub-projects:

1. Smoosic library is the source code for the application and associated library, and is the main Smoosic project repository.
1. vexflow_smoosic repository contains the vexflow engraving library, a sister-project of Smoosic.
1. SmoSchema contains the definition of the Serializable Music Objects that Smoosic uses to persist files, and tools for validation, and possibly other utilities.
1. Demos It contains test and demo applications. If you want to use Smoosic as a library in your own applications, you can use this as a model.
1. SmoSounds library contains .mp3 samples used for audio playback.
1. SmoScores The repository for music written in SMO, or for the SMO application. Contributions and fixes to the default library are welcome.
