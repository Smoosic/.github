# Welcome to the Smoosic Project
This is a top-level readme for the Smoosic music project:
* Smoosic is a typescript/javascript music notation program that runs in the browser
* SMO is a JSON-based file format.  It stands for 'Serialized Musical Objects'.

Most project work for Smoosic will be on the 
[main repository ](https://github.com/Smoosic/Smoosic).  If you are interested in further disucssions, please head over there.

Here is a breakdown of the sub-projects:

1. [vexflow_smoosic](https://github.com/Smoosic/vexflow_smoosic) repository contains the vexflow engraving library, a sister-project of Smoosic.
2. [SmoSounds](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoSounds) library contains .mp3 samples used for audio playback.
3. [Smoosic](https://github.com/Smoosic/Smoosic) library is the source code for the application and associated library, and is the main Smoosic project repository.
4. [SmoSchema](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoSchema) contains the definition of the Serializable Music Objects that Smoosic 
uses to persist files, and tools for validation, and possibly other utilities. 
5. [Demos](https://github.com/Smoosic/Demos) It contains test and demo applications.  If you want to use Smoosic as a library in your own applications, you can use this as a model. 
6. [SmoScores](https://github.com/Smoosic/SmoScores)  The repository for music written in SMO, or for the SMO application.  Contributions and fixes to the default library are welcome.
